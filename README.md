pomodoro method page

I always had the pomodoro method in my ways to study, because of it i can keep hours of concentration and focus.

The process of making this code is simple, using HTML, CSS and Javascript the user can run the timers and an alert will make noise when finished, it's not working cause i'm building it now, in the next steps it will work properly.
